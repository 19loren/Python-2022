 > All python codes developed in 2021/22
#### In this repository, the code is divided into folders:

-   `duo_trio` - Code developed in duo/trios in collaboration with classmates.
-   `exercises` - Exercises done for learning, many of them serve multiple purposes in a single code. The 'python' repository is my first repository and experience with coding & version control, so I try to reorganize it whenever possible.
-   `lists` - Resolution of exercise lists given in class, once again, many files are disorganized, serving multiple purposes in a single file.
